# hello-git
my very first git repo

I have learned the git commands in my env and create a local repo.
I need to publish my repo to public so I can work with it anywhere.
I have no resource to eastablish a private git server, so I choose github.com as my server.
seems github.com is not free for private repo, oops

cool,my first github repo is cloned successfully to local host.
and now, I can edit files and upload

I have deploy my rsa public key to github, so I can push without password.
